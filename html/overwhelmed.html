      <h1>Michael's Guide To Comfort In Overwhelming Times</h1>
      <p>Hi Lydia. You have some challenging weeks/months/years ahead of you, so hopefully some of these can be of some value. I love a good verse or quote when I need to reframe my thoughts or worries.
        Here are some of my favourites at the moment along with my unsolicited commentary.
        
        
         </p>
      <p class="important">
        <h3>So when life seems overwhelming...</h3>
        <table style="width:90%">
          <tr>
            <br>1. Still thank God and pray</br>
            <br></br>
            <br>2. Remember how Jesus fed the 5,000 with 5 loaves and 2 fish. <i>You give what you have completely. trust God and God will take care of the rest, beyond your imagination. </i></br>
            <br></br>
            <br>3. Isaiah 40:31 says, “But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.”</br>
            <br></br>
            <br>4. "Great (wo)men are forged in fire. It is the privilege of lesser (wo)men to light the flame." - Steven Moffat, The War Doctor. <i>An impressive person like you will have haterz, let em hate/i></br>
            <br></br>
            <br>5. "Don't let yesterday use up too much of today."- Michael Takla, 2019 <i> Dont waste the now, you don't know what can happen, things can always change so quickly.</i> </br>
            <br></br>
            <br>6. "When you hit a wrong note, it's the next note that makes it good or bad."- Miles Davis</br>
            <br></br>
            <br>7. Psalm 142:3, He tells us, “When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then You knew my path.”<i>Be overwhelmed by God and not by the worlds stresses (easier said than done though)</i></br>
            <br></br>
            <br>8. "The purpose of life is to be defeated by greater and greater things". Tim O’Reilly.<i> This one is personally my favourite at the moment. If and when you feel defeated by something, how does it compare to past defeats? Was it harder? Then you're doing well. This helps me be okay with catching bigger and bigger L's. </i></br>
            <br></br>
            <br>9. "Everyone is an idiot." - Michael Takla, 2010 <i>super important to remember during school projects</i></br>
            <br></br>
            <br>10. "A joy it will be one day, perhaps, to remember even this." Virgil, The Aeneid. <i>Everything will eventually pass, and even it if sucks right now, there's a chance at some point down the line you might smile thinking about it.</i></br>
            <br></br>         
            <br>11. Matthew 19:26, “But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, with men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.”</br>
            <br></br>
            <br>12. "Do not live far away from God and ask to be happy" - Pope Shenouda</br>
            <br></br>    

            <br> Thats it! Wish you all the best. And if you ever need anyone to complain to, I'm ready for it</tr>

      <h1>Michael's Guide To A Great Residency - Rough Days</h1>
      <p>So firstly, I know nothing about your next four years but it sounds like you might have some challenging days or weeks ahead, so hopefully some of these can be of some value. If it wasn't clear by the daily quotes, I like a good verse or quote when I need to reframe my thoughts or worries.
        Here are some of my favourites at the moment along with my unsolicited commentary.
        
        
         </p>
      <p class="important">
        <h3>So for the rough days...</h3>
        <table style="width:90%">
          <tr>
            <br>1. Still thank God and pray</br>
            <br></br>
            <br>2. “Dude, suckin' at something is the first step to being sorta good at something.” - Michael Takla, 2017. <i>ITS OKAY IF YOU SUCK AT THE BEGINNING.</i></br>
            <br></br>
            <br>3. "Great (wo)men are forged in fire. It is the privilege of lesser (wo)men to light the flame." - Steven Moffat, The War Doctor. <i>This is for when you acquire some haters because of how boss you are. Just thank them for flame.</i></br>
            <br></br>
            <br>4. "Don't let yesterday use up too much of today."- Michael Takla, 2019 (this guy is good) <i> Dont waste the now, so many times the song I'm listening to on my way to work, is very different the song on the way out. Things can always change so quickly.</i> </br>
            <br></br>
            <br>5. "When you hit a wrong note, it's the next note that makes it good or bad."- Miles Davis, famous trumpeter</br>
            <br></br>
            <br>6. "Commit your way to the Lord,
            Trust also in Him,
            And He shall bring it to pass." Psalm 37:5
            </br>
            <br></br>
            <br>7. "The purpose of life is to be defeated by greater and greater things". Tim O’Reilly.<i> This one is personally my favourite at the moment. If and when you feel defeated by something, how does it compare to past defeats? Is it bigger? Then you're doing well. This helps me be okay with catching bigger and bigger L's. </i></br>
            <br></br>
            <br>8. "Everyone is an idiot." - Michael Takla, 2010</br>
            <br></br>
            <br>9. "A joy it will be one day, perhaps, to remember even this." Virgil, The Aeneid. <i>Everything will eventually pass, and even it if sucks right now, there's a chance at some point down the line you might smile thinking about it.</i></br>
            <br></br>         
            <br>10. Joel 2</br>
            <br></br>
            <br>11. "Do not live far away from God and ask to be happy" - Pope Shenouda</br>
            <br></br>
